sorry fro not uploading anything for a while. i have been verry busy with life. a lot of things have happened since my last commit. like the discontinuation of my led matrix project. 

but with that comes a new and improved version. 

armed with all of the information from the led matrix project i was determined. i spent months researching and trying to find exactly what i needed. and i finally found it.

so this repository will cover all of the things i have been working on over the last few months.

i hope that someeone will see this and do something great with it. so i am going to try and be as detailed as possible with this project.

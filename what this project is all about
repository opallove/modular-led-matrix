with the knowlage i learned from my last led matrix project. i have come in full force with this new and improved design.

this led matrix will be modular. meaning you can make it as big as you want. 
but with most modular systems it involves magnets and you can only connect them in two dimmensions. x and y.
i dont know about you but i dont want a display that can fall apart because the magnets werent strong enough to hold it in place. i want a display that is strong and modular.
that and with a magnetic display they have to be connected at the same height or they have to have an akward gap between the displays when changing the angle.
i dont want that. i want a display that keeps a similar led distance even when you are changing the angle that one display is from another.

so thats what i set out to do. 

i spent a few months researching to figure out the best leds and led drivers to use for this project. so that the project would be semi cheap and also somewhat easy to do at home with limited resources. 
eventualy i stumbled appon the WS2812 led and i knew that it was going to be pirfect for the project.

the WS2812 leds have a built in driver for sending and receiving data. this means no external drivers like a multiplexer or anything like that.

now that i knew what leds i was using and i knew i didnt need a multiplexer. I started designing a circuit board. 
this was difficult because i couldnt find any clear referances for the wiring of the board.
so i decided that i would just try something out and hope that it works. and thats what i did. i designed an 8x8 display circuit board and bought it from JLCPCB. i also ordered 100 WS2812 leds.

the total cost of the project at this point was arround $15

$2.21 for the 100 leds.
arround $5 for the circuit board.
and arround $8 for a tube of solder paste.

i intend to keep this project under $100 so that i can expand appon it for cheap.

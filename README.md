# modular-led-matrix
this is a modular led matrix that will let me build custom size and shape led matrix's


and a special thanks to PGtheVRguy @ ( https://github.com/PGtheVRguy ) he is the programmer fro this project. and he has helped make the code that runs on the rpi. he also made a code that converts gif's in to 8x8 24bit bitmap frames that are used on the pi to tell the display what led to light up when. verry cool guy he went out of his way to make the gif conversion code for this project.

here is a link to his gif to bitmap convertion code ( https://github.com/PGtheVRguy/ImageGif-To-Bitmap ) go check it out. it will be usefull if you plan on making one of these displays yourself.
